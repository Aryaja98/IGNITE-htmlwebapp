		><h1><center><span>TIME TRAVEL</span></center></h1><br /><p id="A">Travelling forwards in time is surprisingly easy.
		 Einstein’s special theory of relativity, developed in 1905, shows that time passes at different rates for people who are moving relative to one another - although the effect only becomes large when you get close to the speed of light.
		 If one were to leave Earth in a spacecraft travelling at an appreciable fraction of lightspeed, turn around and come back, only a few years might have passed on board but many years could have gone by on Earth. This is known as the “twins paradox”, since a traveller undertaking such a journey would return to find herself much younger than her twin.
		 Einstein’s theory of gravity that unites space and time as “spacetime”, which curves in the presence of mass. It allows for the possibility of wormholes – a kind of tunnel through spacetime connecting otherwise very distant parts of the universe.

		If the “mouths” of the wormhole are moving relative to one another, then traversing the bridge between different points in space would also take a traveller to a different point in time to that in which she started.

		However it would still be impossible to go back further in time than the point at which the wormhole was created, limiting the options for travel somewhat - and possibly explaining why we haven’t encountered any visitors from the future. If any natural wormholes were formed in the Big Bang, it might be possible to travel to a limited number of points in the past and in the distant universe, but wouldn’t enable one to flit around the cosmos at will as the Doctor seems to do.

		<h1><center><span>PARALLEL UNIVERSE</span></center></h1><br /><p class="a" id="B">The multiverse is a hypothetical set of various possible universes including the universe which we live in
		Our universe may live in one bubble that is sitting in a network of bubble universes in space.
		In 1954, a young Princeton University doctoral candidate named Hugh Everett III came up with a radical idea: That there exist parallel universes, exactly like our universe. These universes are all related to ours; indeed, they branch off from ours, and our universe is branched off of others.
		Within these parallel universes, our wars have had different outcomes than the ones we know. Species that are extinct in our universe have evolved and adapted in others. In other universes, we humans may have become extinct.

		<li>Notions of parallel universes or dimensions that resemble our own have appeared in works of science fiction and have been used as explanations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbps; for metaphysics.</li>
		<li>The multiverse is a theory in which our universe is not the only one, but states that many  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbps;universes exist parallel to each other. These distinct universes within the multiverse theory are called parallel universes.</li>

		<li>The idea of Level 1 parallel universes basically says that space is so big that the rules of probability imply that surely, somewhere else out there, are other planets exactly like Earth. In fact, an infinite universe would have infinitely many planets, and on some of them, the events that play out would be virtually identical to those on our own Earth.</li>
		<li>In a Level 2 parallel universe, regions of space are continuing to undergo an inflation phase. Because of the continuing inflationary phase in these universes, space between us and the other universes is literally expanding faster than the speed of light — and they are, therefore, completely unreachable.</li>
		<center><img src="IGNITEIMG/526.jpg"width="40%"></center>
		<li>Two possible theories present reasons to believe that Level 2 parallel universes may exist: eternal inflation and ekpyrotic theory.</li>
		<li>A Level 3 parallel universe is a consequence of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) from quantum physics in which every single quantum possibility inherent in the quantum wavefunction becomes a real possibility in some reality. When the average person (especially a science fiction fan) thinks of a “parallel universe,” he’s probably thinking of Level 3 parallel universes.</li>
		<li>A Level 4 parallel universe is the strangest place (and most controversial prediction) of all, because it would follow fundamentally different mathematical laws of nature than our universe. In short, any universe that physicists can get to work out on paper would exist, based on the mathematical democracy principle: Any universe that is mathematically possible has equal possibility of actually existing.</li>

		<h1><center><span>BLACKHOLE</span></center></h1><br /><p id="C" align="center">A region of space having a gravitational field so intense that no matter or radiation can escape.
		A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it.
		</p>
		<center><img src="IGNITEIMG/215.jpg"width="40%"></center>
		<ui>
		<li>A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. </li>
		<li>The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space</li>
		<li>his can happen when a star is dying. </li>
		<li>Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible.</li>
		<li>The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</li>
		<li>Billions of them may exist in the Milky Way alone</li>
		<li>Black holes can be big or small. </li>
		<li>Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom.</li>
		<li>These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. </li>
		<li>Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun.</li>
		<li>The largest black holes are called "supermassive."</li>
		<li>These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together.</li>
		<li>Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center.</li>

		<li>Teleportation or teletransportation is the theoretical transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them.</li>
		<li>The ability to move instantaneously from one location to another without physically occupying the space in between. </li>
		<center><img src="IGNITEIMG/522.jpg"width="40%"></center>
		
		<li>Quantum teleportation is a process by which quantum information (e.g. the exact state of an atom or photon) can be transmitted (exactly, in principle) from one location to another, with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and receiving location.</li>
		<center><img src="IGNITEIMG/525.jpg"width="40%"></center>
